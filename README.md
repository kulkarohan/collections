## Overview

[Mirror-style Editions](https://dev.mirror.xyz/AOoIsKPfZvf8LACKWp7gj_mg1ICCDOfPnVBOsDQoXo8) natively on Zora.

## Notes

-   Collections invert fractionalization by creating multiple copies of an NFT
-   1/1 NFT --> _n_/1 NFTs
-   Each NFT in a collection is unique and implements the ERC721 spec; but collectively they all point to the same content hash and token URI they're derived from
